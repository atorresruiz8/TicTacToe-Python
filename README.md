# TicTacToe-Python
A simple two-player Python game that runs in the command line. This game allows two people to play via the same console and checks to see if either player has won by checking the contents of each row, determining if they all match either player's symbols.

# TODO
- Add functionality for diagonal lines to be considered a win.
- Allow the players to choose which symbol they want to use before the game starts.
- Implement pygame functionality to create a window to draw and display the game on for a more appealing visual design.
